            <h4>1. Sprint Name Generator</h4>
    
            <p>Lysender is a team member which practices agile methodology
            called Scrum. Every two weeks or so, there are new features that need to be delivered
            to the e-commerce site and this period is called sprint. Each sprint has a name,
            composed of 2 words starting with the same letter (adjective noun). It starts with
            letter A, for example Agile Aadvark was their first sprint.</p>
    
            <p>This sprint name generator lets you choose a letter and a sprint name is generated
            for you from the list.</p>
